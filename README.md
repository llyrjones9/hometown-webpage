This repository contains a simple web site I developed to practice CSS and HTML. The website's content is currently a very brief advertisement of my (and Kingsman star Taran Egerton's) home town, Aberystwyth!

Going forward, I aim to use this as a template for a personal website to contain an e-profile of my interests, skills and projects I have worked on. Eventually hosted though a cloud provider.

The current content (hometown banner) is hosted via GitHub pages, accessible here: https://llyrjones9.github.io/hometown_banner/
