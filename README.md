# Hometown Banner Static Website
This repository contains a simple static web site I developed to practice CSS and HTML. The website's content is currently a very brief advertisement of my (and Kingsman star Taran Egerton's) home town, Aberystwyth!

Going forward, I aim to use this as a starting point for a personal website to contain an e-profile of my interests, skills and projects I have worked on. Eventually hosted through a cloud provider.

The GitHub pages deployment can be viewed [here](https://llyrjones9.github.io/hometown_banner/).
